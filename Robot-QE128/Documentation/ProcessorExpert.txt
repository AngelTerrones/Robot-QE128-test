Module "IV2"       (component InterruptVector)

Module "MotorD1"   (component PWM)
   - MotorD1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).
   - MotorD1_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the signal generation and events calling. When the timer is 
                disabled, it is possible to call <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods.
   - MotorD1_SetRatio8 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as an 8-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - FF 
                value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined 
                values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer capabilities and on the 
                selected period.
   - MotorD1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. 0 - 
                FFFF value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%. The method is available only if it is not selected list of 
                predefined values in <Starting pulse width> property.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer 
                possibilities and on the selected period.
   - MotorD1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - MotorD1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. The method is available only if it is not selected list of predefined values in 
                <Starting pulse width> property.
   - MotorD1_SetValue -This method sets (set to "1" = "High") timer flip-flop output signal level. It allows to the user to 
                directly set the output pin value (=flip-flop state), and can set the signal polarity. This method only works 
                when the timer is disabled (<Disable> method) otherwise it returns the error code. <ClrValue> and <SetValue> 
                methods are used for setting the initial state.
   - MotorD1_ClrValue -This method clears (set to "0" = "Low") timer flip-flop output signal level. It allows to the user to 
                directly set the output pin value (=flip-flop state), and can set the signal polarity. This method only works 
                when the timer is disabled (<Disable> otherwise it returns the error code. <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods 
                are used for setting the initial state.

Module "MotorD2"   (component BitIO)
   - MotorD2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - MotorD2_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory 
                or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - MotorD2_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Terminal"  (component AsynchroSerial)
   - Terminal_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the send and receive functions. Events may be generated 
                ("DisableEvent"/"EnableEvent").
   - Terminal_Disable -Disables the component - it stops the send and receive functions. No events will be generated.
   - Terminal_EnableEvent -Enables the events. This method is available if the interrupt service/event property is enabled and 
                at least one event is enabled.
   - Terminal_DisableEvent -Disables the events. This method is available if the interrupt service/event property is enabled 
                and at least one event is enabled.
   - Terminal_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - Terminal_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - Terminal_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental 
                error), otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if 
                non-zero length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested 
                number of characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user 
                specified destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter 
                is set to the number of received characters.
   - Terminal_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - Terminal_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - Terminal_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - Terminal_CharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.  [deprecated method]
   - Terminal_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the 
                receiver property is enabled.
   - Terminal_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.
   - Terminal_GetTxComplete -Returns whether the transmitter is finished transmitting all data, preamble, and break characters 
                and is idle. It can be used to determine when it is safe to switch a line driver (e.g. in RS-485 applications). 
                This method is available only if event <OnTxComplete> is disabled.

Module "Encoders"  (component BitsIO)
   - Encoders_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value 
                of the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Encoders_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] 
                then it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).

Module "Cpu"       (component MCF51QE128_64)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
